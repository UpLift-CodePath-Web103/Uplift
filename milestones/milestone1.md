## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Brainstorming and planning the project went well. We had a clear vision of what we wanted to build and were able to come up with a plan to achieve our goals. We also had a productive group meeting where we were able to discuss our ideas and come to a consensus on the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Finding time to meet and work on the project was challenging, as we all have busy schedules. However, we were able to overcome this by using collaborative tools such as Discord to stay connected and work on the project remotely.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Implementing a project management system like Jira will be essential to ensure that we stay on track and make progress towards our goals. This system will enable us to organize tasks, set deadlines, and track progress in a centralized manner, facilitating effective collaboration and remote work. In addition, we will schedule weekly check-ins to review our progress, discuss any challenges, and adjust our plan as needed. This will help us stay focused and ensure that we are making steady progress towards our goals.
